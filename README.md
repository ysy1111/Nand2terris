## Nand2Terris (computer system course project)


#### Project 01: 
Use hardware language to write logic gates.
- And, And16, DMux, DMux4Way, DMux8Way, Mux, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, Mux16, Not, Not16, Or, Or8Way, Or16, Xor

#### Project 02:
Use the logic gates from 01 to build more the arithmetic-logic unit (ALU).
- Add16, ALU-nostat, ALU, FullAdder, HalfAdder, Inc16, Or16Way

#### Project 03:
Use the basic logic gates to realize the memory section of a computer.
- Bit, PC, RAM8, RAM64, Resgister, RAM4K, RAM16K, RAM512

#### Project 04:
Use symbolic machine language to code two functions
- Draw a rectangle on the screen when any key on keyboard is pressed
- Multiplies two values

#### Project 05:
Use all the logic gates from previous project to build a CPU, memory. Then assemble a primitive computer.
- Memory, CPU, Computer

#### Project 06:
Write a Assembly to translate the symbolic machine language into binary code (real machine language) which can be read by machine

#### Project 07:
Write a VWtranslator to translate the VW code into symbolic machine language.

#### Project 08:
Write a advanced VWtranslator to translate the VW code into symbolic machine language.
